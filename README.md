# Predicting-Life-Expectancy
The project tries to create a model based on data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) to evaluate the life expectancy for different countries in years. The data offers a timeframe from 2000 to 2015. The data originates from here: https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who/data The output algorithms have been used to test if they can maintain their accuracy in predicting the life expectancy for data they haven't been trained. Four algorithms have been used:

* Linear Regression
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression
* ElasticNet Regression
* Linear Regression with Polynomic features
* Decision Tree Regression
* Random Forest Regression
